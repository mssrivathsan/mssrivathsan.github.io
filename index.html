                    "Anything that can be connected will be connected" A big callout for all the tech junkies out there . IOT (Internet of things) seems to be the talk of the town nowadays . So what's really in it ?. Simply put this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). This includes everything from cell phones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices and almost anything else you can think of. This also applies to components of machines, for example a jet engine of an airplane or the drill of an oil rig. Say for example you are on your way to a meeting, your car could have access to your calendar and already know the best route to take, if the traffic is heavy your car might send a text to the other party notifying them that you will be late. Never miss a step to revolutionize the world !!!<br><br>
